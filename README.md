# Mapping_Earthquakes

## Assignment
Basil and Sadhana would like to see earthquakes with magnitude greater than 4.5 in relation to the tectonic plates’ location on the earth.

This assignment consists of three technical analysis deliverables:
- Deliverable 1: Using your knowledge of JavaScript, Leaflet.js, and geoJSON data, you’ll add tectonic plate data using d3.json(), add the data using the geoJSON() layer, set the tectonic plate LineString data to stand out on the map, and add the tectonic plate data to the overlay object with the earthquake data.
- Deliverable 2: Using your knowledge of JavaScript, Leaflet.js, and geoJSON data, you’ll add major earthquake data to the map using d3.json(), and a color and set the radius of the circle based on the magnitude of earthquake, and add a popup marker for each earthquake that displays the magnitude and location of the earthquake using the GeoJSON layer, geoJSON().
- Deliverable 3: Using your knowledge of JavaScript and Leaflet.js add a third map style to your earthquake map.

## Deliverable 1: Tectonic Plate Data


## Deliverable 2: Major Earthquake Data


## Deliverable 3: Additional Map
